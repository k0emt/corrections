This project was done in support of "An example driven introduction to Data Science" presentation that I did for the [@KC_DC](https://twitter.com/kc_dc)# Engineer's NotebookI've [documented my thoughts](http://soloso.blogspot.com/2014/05/engineers-notebook.html) about creating and using a notebook.Here I discuss [Today's digital notebook experience](http://soloso.blogspot.com/2014/12/todays-digital-notebook-experience.html).# Finding the data## sourcing the data## learning key words## searching## bearing fruitMissouri Department of Corrections [Sunshine Law Offender Data File](http://doc.mo.gov/Sunshine_Law/index.php)# AnalysisOffender Data File [Layout specification](http://doc.mo.gov/xml/sunshine_layout.xml)The data file is too large for most applications to open.  That is why I have included a [sample file of the first 200 lines of the file](fak930_first_200.txt).# Extract, Transform and LoadAfter you download and extract the Offender Data file, update the path to the file in the [LoadOffenderData.py](LoadOffenderData.py) code.Next, run the python application.  ```python LoadOffenderData.py > offender_data.json```This will result in a new file offender_data.json which is as its name implies, offender data.  You may also see some errors as the result of UTF-8 translation.Individual documents within this created file will look like:```{	"sentenceLengthDays":99,	"suffix":"",	"sentenceDate":"19560316",	"MissouriCharge":"10021040",	"birthDate":"19290622",	"sentenceProbationDate":"00000000",	"probationType":"",	"sentenceLengthYears":9999,	"OffenseDescription":"TC:MURDER1ST-FIST",	"middleName":"",	"sentenceMinimumReleaseDate":"99999999",	"probationTermYears":0,	"sentenceLengthMonths":99,	"CcCsInd":"",	"probationTermDays":0,	"docId":"00000001",	"OffenseCounty":"St.LouisCity",	"completed":"Y",	"NcicCode":"0904",	"firstName":"PAUL",	"CauseNo":"1265D",	"probationTermMonths":0,	"lastName":"SMITH",	"SentenceCounty":"St.LouisCity",	"DocLocFuncFlag":"",	"sentenceMaximumReleaseDate":"99999999",	"offenderAssignedPlace":"",	"race":"Black",	"gender":"Male"}```Now, take this data file and load it into MongoDB.```mongoimport --db doc --collection offender offender_data.json```You'll end up with a `doc` database that contains an `offender` collection that is using ~2G of disk space.# Additional AnalysisUsing the `distinct` operation on the `offenders` collection is a good way to do some discovery work in the data.```> db.offenders.distinct('race')[        "Asian/Pacific Islander",        "Black",        "Nat Am/Alaskan",        "Unknown",        "White"]> db.offenders.distinct('gender')[ "Male", "Female", "Unknown" ]```## Important note about the Missouri Charge field.Refer back to the DOC format description and you will find:> This will contain the 8-digit code associated with this offense from court papers or the Missouri Charge Code Manual. Felony class may be used to insure the correct match. Positions 1 through 5 are the major category code. Positions 6 and 7 contain the NCIC/State Modifier range. These positions of the MO Code match the last two digits of the NCIC code for the charge. The eighth position may be 0 for Not Applicable, 1 for Attempt, 2 for Accessory or 3 for Conspiracy.So, querying for a Murder in the 1st degree, the query would be like this:```> db.offenders.distinct('MissouriCharge',{"MissouriCharge":/^10021.*/})[        "10021040",        "10021070",        "10021990",        "10021020",        "10021010",        "10021030",        "10021110",        "10021120",        "10021991",        "1002199",        "10021993",        "10021992",        "10021090",        "10021",        "10021050",        "10021033",        "10021121",        "10021113",        "10021013",        "10021103",        "10021023",        "10021043"]```## Other fieldsThe `completed` field indicates if they have completed their sentence.`SentenceCounty` may differ from `OffenseCounty`, think change of venue.`sentenceLengthYears` all 9's indicates life sentence.# Visualization# SpringboardI think it would be interesting to get this data into a graph-oriented database and do some querying and visualization that way.  For entities (nodes) I'm thinking offenders, counties and charge would be prime candidates.
